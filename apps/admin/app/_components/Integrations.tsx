  INTEGRATIONS — every outside service, grouped by what it DOES. ADM-D09.
  RADIAN_ADMINISTRATION_MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md, 30 Jul 2026

  The owner's instruction, 30 July: ALL of them here — Facebook, WhatsApp,
  Google, Meta, everything. Grouped, not one flat list, because a flat list makes
  "this one moves money" and "this one counts page views" look like the same kind
  of setting. Payment is first for exactly that reason.

  ⚠️ HOW THIS DOES NOT PUT A KEY IN TWO PLACES. The line is CONNECTION vs
  CONTENT:

     connection — keys, tokens, account numbers, pixel IDs, on/off,
                  sandbox-or-live. "Who are we connected to." → here.
     content    — the WhatsApp message wording, SEO titles, loyalty rates.
                  "What we send over that connection." → stays with Marketing
                  and SEO, which own those rules.

  The old columns in MessagingSetting and TrackingSetting still exist for one
  release — dropping them the same day they moved would leave no way back on a
  live shop — but there is exactly ONE read path on the server, and nothing else
  is allowed to read them.

  ⚠️ EVERY key box uses autoComplete="new-password". Chrome ignores "off"; only
  "new-password" is obeyed. On 29 July it filled the saved shop password into
  three separate key boxes before anybody noticed.

  ⚠️ Secrets arrive MASKED. A blank box therefore means "leave it alone", never
  "clear it" — otherwise opening this page and pressing Save would wipe every
  secret on it. Clearing is an explicit button.

  CARD DESIGN, 6 Aug 2026.

  The owner compared this page with the old site's Payment Gateways screen and
  called this one worse. The difference was never function — save, sandbox/live
  and validation all already worked — it was that the old page gave each
  gateway its own colour, kept the fields open, and used a switch you could see
  from across the room. That is what this card copies.

  What it deliberately does not copy: the old page showed store passwords in
  plain text. Here the overview only ever carries a masked value; the eye asks
  the server for the real one, and every reveal is written to the audit trail.

  One card for every service, whatever it connects to. Two layouts meant a key
  looked more or less important depending on which page it sat on, and there is
  no such thing as a half-important key: a wrong Page token breaks Messenger as

  THE SERVICE CARD.

  Fields are always visible. An "Edit" click before you can even see whether a
  key is set turns a five-second check into a hunt, and the question people
  actually arrive with is "is it set", not "let me change it".

  Two rules about the boxes, both from things that went wrong:

  - Clicking a box selects its contents, it never empties them. Emptying looked
    like the key had been lost, and worse, saving from that state would really
    have lost it.
  - Only boxes that were typed in are sent. Untouched means unchanged; typed
    then emptied means delete. That is the whole of it — there is no Clear
    button, by the owner's instruction.

  COURIERS — ONE CARD PER COURIER, KEYS FOLDED IN. 12 Aug 2026.

  The owner, plainly: having the couriers sit under Delivery is confusing and
  breaks the flow. He was right, and the old note at the top of this proved it —
  it had to explain that names lived on one screen and keys on another, which
  is a sentence no screen should ever need.

  So the courier list IS this section now. A courier is a row you add here;
  its API keys, if the company even has an API, are fields on that same row.

  ⚠️ WHY "HAS KEYS" IS NOT THE SAME AS "EXISTS". The owner first asked for the
  opposite of this — show only couriers that are integrated. That would have
  shut the shop down. The three providers below (Pathao, Steadfast, RedX) are
  a list written in code; there is no way to add a fourth from the panel, and
  most couriers in Bangladesh have no API at all. Tying "can I send a parcel by
  them" to "is there an API key" would have meant SA Paribahan could never
  carry a parcel again, and that a shop with empty key boxes could not despatch
  anything whatsoever. Existing in the list is what makes a courier usable;
  keys only decide whether the consignment number is typed by hand.

  WhatsApp Business app, and the system sends order messages on that SAME
  number. Meta only allows it for a Tech Provider, which Radian became on
  29 Aug 2026.

  The whole middle of this flow belongs to Meta — its popup asks for the
  number, then a code the owner confirms inside the WhatsApp Business app. All
  this button does is open that popup and hand what comes back to the server,
  which exchanges it for the sending token. The app secret never comes here.

  said "Guest" (measured 31 Aug). Getting a wider one by hand would mean copying
  a token out of Meta's Graph Explorer and pasting it into this form — through a
  clipboard and a browser field, which is nowhere a token should go. So Meta's
  popup returns a CODE, the server swaps it for the Page token, and the token is
